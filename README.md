## Objectives
At the end of this course, I will have gained some theoretical programming knowledge but primarily hands on experience with:

- manipulating different data types
- reading in raw data and files
- creating functions
- how to use loops
- work with lists, dictionaries
- gain exposure to object-oriented programming principals

## Outcomes
At the end of this course, I will be able to manipulate different data types, work with real world files and automate simple repetitive tasks - all in Python.
